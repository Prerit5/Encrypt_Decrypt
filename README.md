# Encrypt_Decrypt

This is a c++ application to encryt or decrypt a text document.

The security based software uses a password to get to the main menu.

In the main menu there are 3 options:
1.To Encrypt a file
2.To Decrypt a file
3.To Exit the program

In the first option the user needs to re-enter the password.
After that user will enter the name of a text file(without extension) and append some data in the file.

After succesfully encrypting the data a message will be displayed stating so.

A new file named Encryped_<filename>.txt will be generated. 

In the second option user will enter the original file name.

After succesfully decrypting the data a message will be displayed stating so.

A new file named Decryped_<filename>.txt will be generated.

Third option will be used to exit the program.
